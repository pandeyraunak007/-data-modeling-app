ERWIN COMPLETE COMPARE - USE CASE DOCUMENTATION
================================================================================

TEST SCENARIO: Customer Database Model Evolution v1.2 → v1.3
================================================================

PURPOSE:
This use case demonstrates a real-world database evolution scenario where a
CustomerDB model has been enhanced from version 1.2 to 1.3 to support product
catalog functionality. The Complete Compare tool will identify differences,
conflicts, and new objects between the two model versions.

BUSINESS CONTEXT:
The development team is upgrading their e-commerce customer database to include
product management capabilities. This involves adding new entities, modifying
existing structures, and introducing new constraints and business rules.

================================================================================

SUMMARY STATISTICS:
- Total Objects Compared: 76 objects across both models
- Identical Objects: 18 (remain unchanged)
- Modified Objects: 12 (structural differences)

================================================================================
TESTING PROCEDURE
================================================================================

STEP 1: MODEL SELECTION
-----------------------
1. Open the Complete Compare wizard
2. Verify Left Model shows "CustomerDB_v1.2.erwin"
3. Verify Right Model shows "CustomerDB_v1.3.erwin"
4. Proceed to compare options

STEP 2: CONFIGURE COMPARISON
----------------------------
1. Select "Logical and Physical" comparison level
2. Ensure all object types are selected for comparison:
   ☑ Tables ☑ Views ☑ Indexes ☑ Keys and Constraints ☑ Relationships
3. Enable advanced options:
   ☑ Compare object names ☑ Compare data types ☑ Compare constraints
4. Start the comparison process

STEP 3: REVIEW RESULTS
----------------------
Expected Statistics:
- Total Objects: 76
- Identical: 18 (green background)
- Different: 12 (yellow background with ⚠️ icon)
- Missing in Right: 8 (red background with ❌ icon)
- Missing in Left: 18 (blue background with ➕ icon)

STEP 4: DETAILED OBJECT INSPECTION
----------------------------------
Test each object type by expanding tree groups:

LOGICAL MODEL TESTING:
- Expand "Entities" → Click "Order" → Verify shows 5 vs 6 attributes
- Expand "Relationships" → Click "Order → OrderItem" → Verify cascade changes
- Expand "Domains" → Click "Money_Type" → Verify precision differences

PHYSICAL MODEL TESTING:
- Expand "Tables" → Click "OrderItem" → Verify 4 vs 5 columns
- Expand "Views" → Click "OrderSummary" → Verify definition changes
- Expand "Indexes" → Click "IDX_Order_Date" → Verify single vs composite
- Expand "Keys & Constraints" → Click "FK_Order_Customer" → Verify cascade options

STEP 5: CONFLICT RESOLUTION
---------------------------
Test resolution actions for different conflict types:

1. MODIFICATION CONFLICTS (Yellow ⚠️):
   - Select "Order" table → Choose "Use Right" (accept v1.3 structure)
   - Select "Money_Type" domain → Choose "Merge" (combine precision)

2. MISSING OBJECTS (Red ❌):
   - Select "TempOrder" → Choose "Remove" (deprecate temporary table)
   - Select "UK_Customer_Email" → Choose "Keep" (preserve uniqueness)

3. NEW OBJECTS (Blue ➕):
   - Select "Product" table → Choose "Add" (include new functionality)
   - Select "ProductCatalog" view → Choose "Add" (include new view)

STEP 6: VALIDATION TESTING
--------------------------
1. Click "Auto Resolve" → Verify compatible objects are resolved automatically
2. Navigate through wizard steps using step buttons
3. Test object selection highlighting and detail panel updates
4. Verify tree expansion/collapse functionality
5. Test resolution action buttons and visual feedback

================================================================================
EXPECTED OUTCOMES
================================================================================

SUCCESSFUL TEST COMPLETION:
- All 38 conflicts identified and categorized correctly
- Object details panel shows specific differences for each object
- Resolution actions are available and contextually appropriate
- Tree structure accurately reflects Erwin meta-object hierarchy
- Visual indicators (colors, icons) correctly represent object status

BUSINESS VALUE DEMONSTRATION:
- Database evolution path is clearly visible
- Impact assessment is available for each change
- Data migration requirements are identified
- New functionality integration points are highlighted
- Risk assessment for breaking changes is provided

================================================================================
TROUBLESHOOTING
================================================================================

COMMON TEST ISSUES:
- If tree groups don't expand: Check JavaScript console for errors
- If object counts don't match: Verify all object types are loaded
- If resolution actions don't work: Ensure object selection is active
- If visual updates don't occur: Check CSS class assignments

VALIDATION POINTS:
- Logical Model objects should total 26 in v1.3 vs 24 in v1.2
- Physical Model objects should total 48 in v1.3 vs 42 in v1.2
- Database Objects should total 10 in v1.3 vs 8 in v1.2
- All status indicators should use consistent color coding

================================================================================
CONCLUSION
================================================================================

This use case demonstrates a comprehensive database evolution scenario that
exercises all major Complete Compare functionality including:

✓ Multi-level model comparison (Logical, Physical, Database Objects)
✓ Complex conflict identification and categorization
✓ Comprehensive meta-object support across all Erwin object types
✓ Real-world business scenario with practical resolution decisions
✓ Visual comparison interface with professional Erwin styling
✓ Interactive resolution workflow with multiple action options

The test scenario provides a realistic foundation for evaluating Complete
